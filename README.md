# SMS Door Control
This project allows to build a SMS controlled door buzzer.

## Premises
I rent an old apartment in SF. There is no door man so deliveries are difficult.

To circumvent this, I created this project which allow the delivery company to gain temporary access to the lobby using a text message.

At the same time, I get notified and have remote control to the system through the text interface.

Finally, because I rent, I wanted a none intrusive and damaging system.

## Tools Needed
You can obviously use other tools, but these are the one I used to make this project a reality.

## Notes
Solder: You can use lead free, just get flux and research what you are doing

3D Printer: You can use services like 3dhubs.com instead of getting a machine
